# Kafka Connect Kcql Single Message Transform

Apply SQL like syntax to morph the Kafka message(key or/and value) when using Kafka Connect.

## Why 
Sources or sinks might produce/deal-with data that is not in sync with what you want:
 - you have a kafka topic where you want to pick up specific fields for the sink
 - you might want to flatten the message structure 
 - you might want to rename fields
 - (coming soon) might want to filter messages
 
And you want to express it with a simple syntax! This is where KCQL SMT comes to help you!
